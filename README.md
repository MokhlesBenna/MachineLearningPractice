  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
  <p>Linear regression is a fundamental machine learning technique used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Simple Linear Regression involves predicting a dependent variable using a single independent variable, while Multiple Linear Regression involves predicting a dependent variable using multiple independent variables. This repository provides examples and explanations for both techniques, allowing users to grasp the underlying concepts and apply them in their own projects.</p>

  <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
  <p>To use the code in this repository, you'll need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python Downloads</a></p>

  <p>The scikit-learn library is a dependency for this project, which can be installed using pip, a package installer for Python. Open your command prompt or terminal and run the following command:</p>

  <pre><code>pip install scikit-learn</code></pre>

  <h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
  <p>The repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression. You can clone the repository or download the individual scripts to use them in your own projects.</p>

  <p>To run a script, open your command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located. Then, execute the script using the Python interpreter. For example:</p>

  <pre><code>python simple_linear_regression.py</code></pre>

  <p>Feel free to explore the code and modify it to suit your specific requirements. Make sure to read the comments within the scripts, as they provide explanations and instructions for each step of the regression process.</p>

  <h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
  <p>This repository provides the following examples of linear regression techniques:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Simple Linear Regression:</strong> This example demonstrates how to perform simple linear regression using a single independent variable to predict a dependent variable. It covers concepts such as data preprocessing, model training, model evaluation, and making predictions.</li>
    <li><strong>Multiple Linear Regression:</strong> This example showcases multiple linear regression, where multiple independent variables are used to predict a dependent variable. It covers similar concepts as simple linear regression but with the added complexity of handling multiple features.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Each example includes a dataset and a step-by-step explanation of the code, guiding users through the process of implementing linear regression models and interpreting the results.</p>

  <h2 id="contributing">Contributing</h2>
  <p>Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have any suggestions, improvements, or additional examples to add, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Your contributions will help make this resource more valuable to users learning about linear regression.</p>

  <p>When contributing, please ensure that your code follows best practices, adheres to the existing coding style, and provides clear documentation and explanations for the changes or additions you make.</p>
